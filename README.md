# My Universal Blue based personal Linux image

## Objectives
* Base on Bazzite for best hardware support (and occasional gaming)
* Provide Sway tiling window manager for more productive work environment
* Unscrew Sway login with SDDM to work around anti-Nvidia zealotry

**NOTE**: This is a work in progress (some things are still broken) and currently relies on my private dotfile configurations which aren't included. It is heavily opinionated and tailored to my own hardware. Feel free to look at but please don't use it yourself if you want a working environment.

## TODO
1. Fix brightness control in Sway
1. Fix power profiles missing in waybar
1. Move personal dotfile configuration into distribution
