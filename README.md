# My Universal Blue based Linux image

# Objectives:
* Base on Bazzite for best hardware support (and occasional gaming)
* Provide Sway Desktop for most productive work environment
* Unscrew Sway with SDDM to work around anti-Nvidia zealotry

*NOTE* This is a work in progress and also currently relies on my private dotfile 
configurations. Feel free to peruse but please don't use if you want a working
environment.
