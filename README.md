# My Universal Blue based personal Linux image

**NOTE**: This is a work in progress (some things are still broken) and currently relies on my private dotfile configurations which aren't included. It is heavily opinionated and tailored to my own hardware. Feel free to look at but please don't use it yourself if you want a working environment.

## Objectives
* Base on Bazzite for best hardware support (and occasional gaming)
* Provide Sway tiling window manager for more productive work environment
* Unscrew Sway login with SDDM to work around anti-Nvidia zealotry

## TODO
1. Move some elements of personal dotfile configuration into distribution
2. Find out how to build weekly updates even if no change by me.
